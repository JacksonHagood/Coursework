Abstract Data Type Tester
CSCE 221 (inspired from coursework)

Tester for implementations of six abstract data
types. Includes queue, stack, linked list,
priority queue, binary tree, and graph. All of
the code, including the ADT implementations are
entirely my own. Not linked to any assignment or
class-specific materials, therefore source code
is provided.

Run using ./tester.
